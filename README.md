# Java Console Calculator

The calculator:
- Take two numbers and an operator as input from the user.
- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo based on the input.
- Use separate methods for each operation.
- Use a loop to allow the user to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.

## What I Implemented

- Used `Scanner` for reading user input.
- Created separate methods for each arithmetic operation.
- Handled division by zero with a user-friendly message.
- Used a `do-while` loop for continuous calculation until the user exits.
- Ensured the program is easy to read and reusable.
